# BAYESIAN STATISTICS 

## INTRODUCTION - RE-ALLOCATION OF CREDIBILITY

In this project, we will study the conceptual framework of Bayesian statistics in terms of reallocation of credibility across possibilities and practical steps of Bayesian Analysis .

### Difference between classical and Bayesian points of view is demonstrated as follows:

### Example
Let us consider a construction site. An explosion at this site could have occurred as a result of :
1.	static electricity,
2.	malfunctioning of equipment, 3. carelessness, or
4.  sabotage.
There is no reason out of those in the list:

we will look at how bayesian analysis is applied to a situation and the cause of the probelem is identified in this project.
